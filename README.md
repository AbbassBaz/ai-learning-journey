# 🧠 AI Learning Journey — From Software Developer to AI Engineer

Welcome to my personal learning journey as I transition from software development into AI engineering. This repository documents my daily progress through structured study, hands-on implementation, and real-world projects using Python, Scikit-learn, and other tools.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong foundation in machine learning and artificial intelligence through consistent, practical learning — one day at a time.

---

## 📚 Weekly Structure

Each week focuses on a key area of AI and ML:
- **Week 1**: Supervised Learning Fundamentals
- Week 2+: (to be updated as I progress)

## ✅ Progress Snapshot

| Day | Focus | Key Concepts |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| Day 1 | AI/ML basics | AI vs ML vs DL, real-world use cases |
| Day 2 | Linear regression | Regression problem, `.fit()` and `.predict()` |
| Day 3 | Classification | Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, accuracy |

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🚀 What's Next

- Explore non-linear models (SVM, KNN)
- Dive into overfitting, underfitting, cross-validation
- Start working with real-world datasets (e.g., Titanic, spam detection)
- Move toward neural networks and deep learning (PyTorch or TensorFlow)

## 🧩 Why This Repo Exists

I created this as both a personal commitment and a public roadmap for anyone shifting from software development into machine learning. Feel free to clone, fork, or follow along.

Let’s build smarter systems, one notebook at a time.
